        <h3>Long-term rental of kitchenette suites</h3>
            <p>
                One day the owner of Temple Inn and Suites was outside the temple enjoying the grounds when he got involved in a conversation with a missionary couple serving full-time in the temple.  As they talked he discovered that this missionary had no place to stay close to the temple and they were currently staying with another temple worker who lived quite far away himself.  The burden of having no space of their own combined with the long drive was beginning to wear on the missionaries and they hoped they would be able to find a good solution to this problem. To remedy this issue the owner proudly declared that kitchenette suites would be made available to missionaries serving full time at the temple for affordable prices.  That tradition started many years ago continues today.
            </p>

            <p>
                For those diligently serving in the House of The Lord far from home we offer affordable rental of our kitchenette suites. Please note that you must be currently serving full-time in the temple to qualify for this discount. 
            </p>
